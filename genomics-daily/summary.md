# Genomic Frontiers: Unraveling Complexity in Biology, Medicine, and Evolution

Recent advances in genomics are revealing intricate layers of biological complexity, from understanding gene regulation to exploring disease mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics. Three groundbreaking studies showcase how cutting-edge genomic approaches are transforming our comprehension of biological systems across diverse domains.

## üß¨ Decoding RNA Structure: A Revolutionary Approach

The Nature publication by Degenhardt et al. introduces HORNET, a groundbreaking method for determining three-dimensional structures of heterogeneous RNA molecules. By combining atomic force microscopy, unsupervised machine learning, and deep neural networks, researchers can now capture the complex structural configurations of large, flexible RNA molecules that were previously challenging to study.

## üî¨ Nucleus-Forming Phages: Insights into Bacterial Defense Mechanisms

Harding et al.'s research in Nucleic Acids Research provides a comprehensive exploration of bacterial gene requirements during nucleus-forming jumbo phage infections. By employing high-throughput transposon mutagenesis and CRISPR interference, the study identified over 90 host genes involved in phage infection, predominantly related to bacterial receptor biosynthesis, flagella, and motility.

## üåç Treponemal Disease Evolution: Rewriting Historical Narratives

The Nature publication by Barquera et al. presents a groundbreaking analysis of ancient treponemal genomes from the Americas, challenging existing hypotheses about the origin of diseases like syphilis. By examining five pre- and peri-contact ancient genomes, the researchers provide compelling evidence supporting an American origin for all characterized Treponema pallidum lineages.
