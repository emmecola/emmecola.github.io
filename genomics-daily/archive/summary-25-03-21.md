# Genomic Frontiers: Unraveling Complexity through Advanced Sequencing and Computational Approaches

The rapidly evolving field of genomics continues to push the boundaries of scientific understanding, leveraging cutting-edge technologies to decode the intricate mechanisms of genetic variation, disease, and biological adaptation. This editorial highlights three groundbreaking studies that demonstrate the power of innovative genomic approaches in addressing complex biological questions across diverse domains.

## üß¨ Optical Genome Mapping: A New Frontier in Repeat Expansion Diagnostics

Van der Sanden and colleagues revolutionize the detection of short tandem repeat (STR) expansions by introducing optical genome mapping (OGM) as a comprehensive diagnostic tool. Their study showcases OGM's remarkable ability to accurately identify pathogenic repeat expansions across multiple disease-causing genes, overcoming limitations of traditional molecular techniques. By successfully characterizing 98.8% of known pathogenic expansions and detecting somatic instability, this approach represents a significant advancement in genetic diagnostics, particularly for neurological disorders like myotonic dystrophy and cerebellar ataxia.

## üî¨ Structural Variants Unveiled: Integrating Transcriptomics and Long-Read Genomics

Jensen and colleagues demonstrate the transformative potential of long-read sequencing in rare disease research by integrating genomic and transcriptomic data to prioritize structural variants (SVs). Their innovative approach, Watershed-SV, leverages machine learning to identify functional SVs by correlating genomic variations with gene expression patterns. The study not only increases SV detection by 2.4 times compared to short-read sequencing but also successfully identified compound heterozygous deletions potentially causing a rare neurodevelopmental disorder, highlighting the power of comprehensive genomic analysis.

## üåç Expanding the Methylome: Structural Variants and Epigenetic Landscape

Groza et al. present a groundbreaking study that expands our understanding of the human methylome by utilizing pangenome graph approaches. By analyzing 782 de novo assemblies, they discovered 14.6 million previously uncharacterized CpG dinucleotides, significantly expanding our knowledge of genetic variation and methylation. The research reveals over 230,000 methylation quantitative trait loci associated with structural variants, demonstrating the complex interplay between genetic variation and epigenetic regulation.
