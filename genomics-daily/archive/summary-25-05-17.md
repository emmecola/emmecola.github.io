# Genomic Frontiers: Decoding Life's Complexity Through Cutting-Edge Research

Recent advances in genomics are revealing unprecedented insights into biological systems, from marine ecosystems to human diseases and plant genetics. This editorial highlights three groundbreaking studies that demonstrate the power of genomic approaches in understanding complex biological phenomena across diverse domains.

## üê¨ Environmental DNA: Unveiling Marine Biodiversity in Korean Waters

The study by Lee Sung Bin and colleagues represents a significant breakthrough in marine biodiversity monitoring using environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques. By extracting genetic material from seawater samples, researchers successfully detected the presence of finless porpoises and various dolphin species around the Korean Peninsula, including previously unconfirmed populations near Jeju Island. This non-invasive approach not only provides a comprehensive snapshot of marine mammal distribution but also overcomes traditional visual survey limitations, offering a powerful tool for ecological research and conservation efforts.

## üß¨ Genomic Insights into Hereditary Colorectal Cancer Risk Detection

Yang Liyuan's research offers a critical perspective on early malignancy detection among first-degree relatives of hereditary colorectal cancer patients. By employing the Health Belief Model, the study revealed that only 23% of first-degree relatives underwent early malignancy detection. Importantly, the research identified key predictors of early detection, including knowledge scores, perceived susceptibility, and self-efficacy. These findings highlight the potential for personalized genetic counseling and targeted cancer risk assessment strategies, which could significantly improve early intervention and prevention in high-risk populations.

## üåø Comprehensive Genomic Analysis of Cytochrome P450 Genes in Chrysanthemum

Chen Yuyuan's genome-wide study of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) genes in Chrysanthemum indicum provides unprecedented insights into plant metabolic diversity. By identifying 371 CYP450 genes and analyzing their evolutionary patterns, the researchers uncovered complex gene duplication events and extensive genetic variations. The study not only mapped the genetic landscape of these crucial enzymatic genes but also correlated gene expression with volatile organic compound production, offering valuable resources for molecular breeding and understanding secondary metabolite biosynthesis in this economically important ornamental and medicinal plant.
