Hi, I am Moreno Colaiacovo.

I am a bioinformatician with expertise in NGS data analysis. I am currently working as an IT consultant at the [Joint Research Centre](https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/index_en) in Ispra, Italy. Here I provide bioinformatics support to the activities of the European Reference Laboratory for Genetically Modified Food and Feed ([EURL GMFF](https://gmo-crl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/)), performing bioinformatics analyses, maintaining the current website and bioinformatics infrastructure and developing web applications.

I like science and science communication.
